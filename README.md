<h1>Creation and Lifecycle osTicket</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this tutorial, I’m going to demonstrate how a ticket is created and how it moves through its lifecycle in osTicket, from creation to resolution. Let’s follow the journey of a ticket created by Karen for an HR employee who is having issues powering on their laptop.
<br />

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>

The user goes to the Ticket Submission page, fills in the details of the issue, and submits the ticket.<br/>

<br />
<br />Karen, the user, submits a ticket describing the issue. The ticket states that an HR employee is experiencing problems powering on their laptop.<br />

<br />Go to Agent Panel > Tickets > Open. Here, you’ll find all the tickets that have been submitted and are still open.<br />

<br />For this example, we will assign the ticket to Agent Jane.<br />
<br />Change the SLA (Service Level Agreement) to SEV-C (Low Priority), since this issue isn’t urgent but still needs to be addressed.<br />

<br />Once Jane has reviewed the ticket and resolved the issue (in this case, fixing the laptop power issue), Jane will need to update the ticket.<br />

<br />Agent Jane will post a reply in the ticket, describing how the issue was resolved<br />

After posting the solution, Jane changes the ticket status from Open to Resolved to indicate the issue has been addressed.
Jane leaves a final note to summarize the resolution before closing the ticket.
<br />Once the ticket has been marked as Resolved, the final step is to close the ticket.<br />

<br />In this tutorial, we demonstrated the lifecycle of a ticket in osTicket. Starting from Karen creating the ticket, to assigning the ticket to agent Jane, resolving the issue, and finally closing it.
